The 419 series (419-kei) was an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type introduced in 1985 by Japanese National Railways (JNR), and later operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR-West) on local services along the Japan Sea coast of Japan until March 2011. They were converted from former 583 series sleeping car EMUs in the 1980s.
