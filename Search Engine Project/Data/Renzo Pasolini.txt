Renzo Pasolini (18 July 1938 – 20 May 1973), nicknamed "Paso", was an Italian professional Grand Prix motorcycle road racer in the 1960s and early 1970s.

Despite his career getting interrupted at its peak by his tragic death, Pasolini has been an immensely popular rider and has left a unique mark in Grand Prix racing. His unpredictable and unrehearsed racing style combined with his charismatic and straight-forward personality made him a crowd favourite. Pasolini's rivalry with Giacomo Agostini divided motorcycling enthusiasts, and while Pasolini's style brought mixed results (ultimately preventing him from winning a world title), it earned him a place in the hearts of many fans.

In 1985, Ducati presented at EICMA the Ducati Paso 750, named after Pasolini.
