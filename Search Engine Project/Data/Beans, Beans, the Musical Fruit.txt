"Beans, Beans, The Magical Fruit" is a playground saying and children's song about the capacity for beans to contribute to flatulence.

The basis of the song (and bean/fart humor in general) is the high amount of oligosaccharides present in beans. Bacteria in the large intestine digest these sugars, producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These gases are expelled from the body as flatulence.
